# tic-tac-toe
This is a Python scrip for tic tac toe 
This python script create a tic tac toe board (interface), where two players can enjoy playing the game.

  - 2 players should be able to play the game (both sitting at the same computer)
  - The board should be printed out every time a player makes a move
  - You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbol on the board
  - 
After choosing the X or O symbol, we use the keyboard numpad to place the symbol on the game board. Numer one from the numpad is the downleft cell from the board and number 9 is the upper right cell. ENJOY!
